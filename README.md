# NextPlay Backend

NextPlay is a Spring Boot backend for a game discovery and recommendation platform.

The goal of this project is to help users browse games, search and filter game data, save games to a personal library, track game progress, write reviews, and receive personalized game recommendations based on genres, platforms, ratings, library activity, and user reviews.

This project is being built step-by-step while relearning and practicing Spring Boot backend development.

---

## Project Goal

The final goal of NextPlay is to become a full backend platform where users can:

- Browse games
- Search and filter games
- View game details
- Create accounts
- Log in securely
- Save games to a personal library
- Track games as want to play, playing, completed, or dropped
- Rate and review games
- View reviews for games
- View their own reviews
- Receive personalized game recommendations
- View trending and top-rated games

Admin users can eventually be able to:

- Add games
- Update games
- Delete games
- Manage game information
- Moderate reviews

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd nextplay-backend
```

### 2. Configure the database

Update the database settings inside:

```text
src/main/resources/application.properties
```

Example PostgreSQL configuration:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/nextplay
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
```

Example MySQL configuration:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/nextplay
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
```

### 3. Run the application

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend should start on:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

## Testing

Postman is being used to manually test the backend.

Current testing includes:

- Verifying that the backend starts successfully
- Checking that the health route works
- Creating game records
- Retrieving game records
- Updating game records
- Deleting game records
- Searching and filtering game records
- Testing pagination and sorting
- Registering users
- Logging in users
- Testing protected routes with JWT tokens
- Adding games to a user's library
- Updating a game's library status
- Removing games from a user's library
- Creating game reviews
- Updating game reviews
- Deleting game reviews
- Retrieving reviews for a game
- Retrieving reviews for the logged-in user
- Confirming average game ratings update after review changes
- Testing recommendation results
- Confirming validation behavior
- Confirming error handling behavior
